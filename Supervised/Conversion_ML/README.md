# Conversion rate challenge

## Project description
www.datascienceweekly.org is a famous newsletter curated by independent data scientists. Anyone can register his/her e-mail address on this website to receive weekly news about data science and its applications !

The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.

## Goals

Create the best model possible by: 

- Doing an exploratory data analysis
- Try several models and comapre them
- Analyze the models' parameters
- Test the best models with unknown data


## Dataset
The datasets can be found as csv files in this folder.

## Usage
The notebook can be run given that the user meets the package requirements found in the root directory.

## Contributors

This project was made by Nicolas Leurs as part of the Jedha Bootcamp Data science and engineering Fullstack course and was submitted to validate part of the French certificate "Machine Learning Engineer".
