# Walmart sales

## Project description

Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

## Goals

Create the best model possible by: 

- Doing an exploratory data analysis
- Training a linear regression model (baseline model)
- Avoiding overfitting by training regularized regression models

## Dataset
The dataset can be found as csv file in this folder.

## Usage
The notebook can be run given that the user meets the package requirements found in the root directory.

## Contributors

This project was made by Nicolas Leurs as part of the Jedha Bootcamp Data science and engineering Fullstack course and was submitted to validate part of the French certificate "Machine Learning Engineer".
