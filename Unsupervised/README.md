# Uber pickups

## Project description
The objective was to create an algorithm that could determine where are the hot-zones that uber drivers should be in.

To this end a dataset from Uber in the city of New York was used .

## Goals

- Create an algorithm to find hot zones
- Ready these algorithms for deployement


## Dataset
The dataset can be retrieved [here](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip)


## Usage
The notebook can be run given that the user meets the package requirements found in the root directory.

## Contributors
