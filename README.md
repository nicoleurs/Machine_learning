# Machine Learning Projects

In this repository you can find two folders with projects I worked on as part of my Data science and engineering certification at Jedha Bootcamp

## Supervised Machine Learning

**This folder contains two different projects:**

- Walmart sales : the goal was to make a model that could predict walmart weekly sales with the best possible precision on the predictions. 
- Conversion rate challenge : The goal was to compete with other students to see who could make the best model for predicting conversion rate from non-subscriber to subscriber of a data science newsletter

For more information you can consult the dedicated README files inside each porject folder.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

**This folder contains a single project:**

- Uber pickups : the objective was to create an algorithm that could determine where are the hot-zones that uber drivers should be in.

For more information you can consult the dedicated README file inside the folder.
